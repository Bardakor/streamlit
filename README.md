This project is a **Streamlit** application called **Maritime Insights Dashboard**. It offers a comprehensive overview of maritime operations, integrating data from various sources to visualize key metrics and insights. The dashboard is designed for stakeholders in the maritime industry who want to monitor, analyze, and gain insights into different maritime activities.

## 🚢 Features Overview

### 🌍 Key Maritime Metrics
- **Total Voyages**: Displays the total number of voyages currently recorded.
- **Unique Ports**: Shows the number of unique ports accessed.
- **Vessel Types**: Displays the different types of vessels involved.
- **Active Users**: Indicates the number of active users.

### 🌐 Port and Vessel Insights
- **Top 10 Ports by Usage**: A chart showing the ports with the highest frequency of use.
- **Vessel Distribution**: Visual representation of vessel types and their frequency.

### 🌊 Voyage Analysis
- **Interactive Voyage Map**: Map view showcasing the routes of different voyages.
- **Voyage Durations Distribution**: Histogram displaying the distribution of voyage durations, allowing users to analyze common voyage lengths.

### 🔍 Analysis Overview
This section provides a **high-level overview** of maritime operations and highlights patterns, trends, and valuable metrics for stakeholders to act upon.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the web application.
- **Python**: Backend language for data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly** or **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Geopandas**: To handle geospatial data for interactive mapping.

## 📁 File Structure
- **app.py**: The main file to run the Streamlit application.
